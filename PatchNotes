v1.0: released
v2.0: "redesigned" UI, capable of saving to a file, code finally commented
v2.0.1: Several performance optimizations, useless lines of code cut (over 20 lines! Wow, I'm a bad developer lol), main code's a bit more simple
v2.0.1.1: slight tweak to the password saving part of the code, line breaks now more "reliable"
v2.0.2: fixed a bug where a password would generate on top of another password if userInput received neither Y or N
v2.1: slight tweak to UI, read functionality added, platform-specific versions created
v2.1.1: fixed a bug where after making a password FastMode would list all passwords
v2.2: added a "cancel" feature when making passwords
v3.0: Completely rewritten code and is now easier to modify, passwords are now encoded to make stealing passwords directly from the passlist file harder*, added an installer to
      make setting up easier and faster**
      *FastMode 3.0 is completely incompatible with older unprotected passwords and you will have to encode them yourself if you want to have them work
      **FastMode 3.0 is incompatible with macOS and Linux due to their different file directory structures, both the installer and the program itself will refuse to boot
      on macOS and Linux
